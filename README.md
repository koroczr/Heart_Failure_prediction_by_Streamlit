About this dataset
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

# About the project:

This application is able to predict the Death or No Death event based on the raw Dataset. I have used Random Forest Classifier for this project.
As you can see the Accuracy is 81,1% (Help_for_Creation file !). For the future steps, I will find alternative models and better parameters for more accurate prediction.

## For the execute please use Streamlit package !
Installation: pip install streamlit
Execute: streamlit run ...(file) 
  For instance: streamlit run Heart_Failure_prediction_by_Streamlit.py
